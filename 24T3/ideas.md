# Ideas
1. chrome extension for valorant-style ranks for leetcode, with friends 
2. comp sci / swe specific accountability app
3. Decision making app:  For times when you're with friends and are arguing over what to do (what to eat, what games to play, etc.).  I was thinking that the app starts off with you inputting your question (e.g. What should we eat). Once the question has been submitted, it starts a lobby (kind of like kahoot), and other people can join it, as well as submit their own answers to the question, or select other players answers.  Once the answer submission phase is finished (timed out or admin (question submitter) clicks next), it comes up with a list of mini games (kind of like that Game Pigeon app on iPhone) to "battle" over who wins.  Potential minigames:  - Wheelspin (in the case where one answer has multiple votes, their section on the wheel is larger) - Plinko  - Scissors paper rock (has limitation of needing to create seeding and would also be kind of boring) - tap game (whoever taps their screen the most wins, but players with the same answer will be on the same team, so their scores would be combined)
4. project "tinder"  user submits their project idea/s and then other users can swipe on it if theyd be interested
